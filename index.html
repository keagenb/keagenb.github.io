                    <h3>Software Development</h3>
                    <p>My time at WSU has prepared me to write, test, debug, and deploy code for various projects. I became most familiar with C/C++ and Python through data structures courses, but I have completed assignments using C#, and Haskell.</p>

                    <h3>Design + Web Development</h3>
                    <p>Ever since middle school I have had a passion for technical skills and graphic design. This partnered with my CS education has helped tremendously in my time learning about web development/design and while I was teaching students at iDTech.</p>

            <h2 class="section__title section__title--about">Who I Am</h2>
            <p class="section__subtitle section__subtitle--about">Student of Computer Science at Washington State University</p>

            <div class="about-me__body">
                <p>"Above and beyond" is my calling. I believe that my strongest trait is my ability to adapt and learn. The CS industry is all about learning to live with constantly evolving technology, tools, and methodologies. Wherever I wind up, I know that my time leading and learning will help me to fit into any workplace.</p>
                <p>I was born in Utah and raised in Wyoming, but when I was 11 I moved with my family to Puyallup, Washington. Since then, I have made so many friends and have been introduced to so many opportunities. In my free time I have always been interested in technical tools; whether it be digital illustration, video editing, social media management, special effects, 3D modeling/printing, or recording and editing electric guitar covers. If it's anything tech related, I'm all over it. All of this helped me to find my way to feeling right at home studying Computer Science at WSU. </p>
                <p>Ultimately, I hope to put all of my experience to work in a Full-Stack Software Development role. I do have a lot of personal experience with graphic design and web development, and I know that this will go hand-in-hand with my knowledge of systems programming, databases, and language design. If you have a tool that I'm inexperienced with, my pledge is that I can quickly envelope myself into that technology and add it to my skillset. </p>
