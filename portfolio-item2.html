            <p>"Mega Mini Golf" is everyone's favorite recreational activity with an extreme twist. Because we are proud WSU students, a 'Cougars vs Huskies' motif was used in this game similar to 'The Legend of the Crimson King'. In the Fall of 2020, as part of an Advanced Data Structures course, our final project required that we develope some form of game that has graphics and makes use of a data structure that we covered in class. Suggested ideas included: Battleship, Connect Four, Tic Tac Toe, Backgammon, etc. My partner, Bobby Templin, and I saw the allowance of Unreal Engine for this project and we were inspired to go the extra mile.</p>
            <img src="img/mmg1.png" alt="">
            <p>At the start of this project neither of us had ever touched Unreal Engine. In under two weeks we were able to learn how to create 'characters', manage game states, move between levels, keep and update game score, and more. We spent a few sleepless nights diving into documentation, YouTube playlists, and even Unreal Engine specific Discord channels to translate our ideas into manageable goals that can be implemented within the engine. </p>
            <img src="img/mmg3.png" alt="">
            <p> One initial challenge was uncovering the relationship between hand written C++ code and Unreal Engine's built in Blueprints. Bobby had done some research and refreshed his Linear Algebra knowledge to develope a scene where one's cursor would be tracked from the center of a ball. And based on where that player clicks, the ball would be provided a direction and momentum. From there, Blueprints I had created to manage the Graphic User Interface, the main menu, to update player data, and to transition game states needed to access and work with that C++ code. In time we discovered how to access the code within the Blueprints, and this enabled us to update the player score and to move the player between levels/holes. </p>
            <img src="img/mmg4.png" alt="">
            <p> In meeting the data structure requirement, standard maps were used to store and manage the various levels/holes. Each hole has an ID and a location in 3D space, and there is a specific order the player needs to visit the holes in to play our course correctly. Much of what we learned about the interconnectivity of Blueprints and code helped us in managing and updating the score, location, current par, strokes, and more. All 3D models were created and textured by Bobby in Blender, and all graphics/UI were designed by me in the Adobe Creative Suite. Additional graphics were accessed and used when appropriate (such as the Cougar and Husky on the main screen).</p>
