            <p>Before taking Computer Science 360, I had never done anything in Linux. As part of this Systems Programming course we completed assignments with VS Code in an Ubuntu system, which I accessed via VirtualBox. This course taught us about the call stack, the function of Linux operations, and the data processing being done in the background.</p>
            <img src="img/ext1.PNG" alt="">
            <p>Students had gained experience with virtual disks in a previous assignments where we were tasked with opening, reading, and parsing them. This helped a lot in our initial iteration of the final project where we needed to implement the mount root function for an EXT2 file system. Loading and reading a disk was the start of this entire program, so our project relied heavily on this. Later iterations allowed users to manipulate the files found on the disk that they opened, and to create their own as well.</p>
            <img src="img/ext2.PNG" alt="">
            <p>For this project we were provided with some sample code, and had direction from the textbook "Systems Programming in Unix/Linux by" K.C. Wang. Our main file reads in user input and then directs to other appropriate files to carry out specified commands. In all our program implemented mountroot, ls, cd, pwd, mkdir, creat, rmdir, link, unlink, symlink, readlink, stat, chmod, and quit functions.</p>

            <p> This course was fairly challenging for me, and introduced me to an environment and tools that I wasn't comfortable with at the time. I had never dual booted or used VirtualBox, so this was a class where I really expanded my horizons and learned a lot. From this experience I can confidently say that I can join a team and in time fit into their work flow by diving into the tools and workspaces that they use. The computer science field has an abundance of challenges, and I'm excited to tackle any that come my way. </p>
